After working at a few shops in Winston-Salem, Jamey opened Thruway Barbershop in Mt Airy in 2009. When the opportunity arose to be a part of the Don’s Barbershop Team, Jamey jumped at the chance. Now he is close to home and can spend more time with his beautiful wife, Christy, and his 4 youngsters. Jamey’s excellent barber skills coupled with his passion for customer service make him a perfect fit at Don’s Barbershop in King, NC.",
